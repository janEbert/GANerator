# GANerator

### Try out, analyze and generate your generators in PyTorch!

An easily usable, performant and extennsible interface for all your GAN needs.

Training [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)
(GANs) is a tiresome and hard task. This is primarily because GAN training has
not been well understood yet even after a lot of research went into creating,
understanding and implementing new methods for regularizing and improving GAN
training (such as [virtual batch 
normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498), [spectral 
normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957) or
[boundary equilibria](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10717)).

In an effort to improve and accelerate research in GAN training, this
repository collects state of the art approaches and best practices in a modular
fashion to enable users to quickly switch between and try out different methods
to find out what works best for their current situation. For that, I provide a
Jupyter Notebook. A pure Python version is planned which may be more 
comfortable depending on your use case.

## Current Features

Supported framework:
- PyTorch

Other:
- True and tested normalizations for GANs (including a [virtual batch 
  normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498) layer)
- Experimental setup for testing and saving many different parameters
- Many [GAN hacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks)

This repository offers working multiprocessing on multiple GPUs and CPUs, a
collection of smart parameters that are documented and easily usable. In the
end, you have an understandable environment for GAN training working out of the
box.

## Setup

You will need [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/),
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
(including Torchvision). If you want to use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
notebook, install that as well (mandatory at the moment as we only have the
notebook).
To save animations of your GAN training, you may want either
[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (mp4) or [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
(gif).

I do not offer installation instructions or a setup file due to the differences
between CPU and GPU packages. Please look that stuff up yourself in the
following links.

Installation instructions for:
- [NumPy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)

### Coding style

At the moment, in the notebook, I do not adhere to the PEP 8 line size
guideline. I feel that notebooks are in most cases supposed to be in fullscreen
and readability would suffer, especially concerning documentation â€” sorry! If
there are enough complaints or I change my mind, I will modify the code
accordingly.

Any pure Python code later will be documented in ReStructuredText following PEP
257 and I will limit code and comments to a certain line size.

## TODOs

Methods to implement (still growing):
- feature matching
- minibatch discrimination
- historical averaging
- one sided label smoothing
- bounded equilibrium GANs
- some missing stuff from [ganhacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks)

Evaluation methods:
- inception score
- semi-supervised learning

Other:
- convolutional layer visualization
- distributed computing version (Horovod?)
- grid search supporting cloud computing providers
- more datasets
- data other than images (sound, 3D objects, ...)
- arbitrary data (anything else)
- [CelebA-HQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196) generation
- perhaps more frameworks
- Julia version
